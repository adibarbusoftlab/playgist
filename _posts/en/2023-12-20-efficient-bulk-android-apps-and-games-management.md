Managing all your apps and games individually can become quite messy, especially when handling tasks like updates, cleanup, uninstallation, reinstallation, and subscription renewals. Fortunately, there's a more efficient way to handle these tasks: performing operations for all apps or selecting specific groups of apps or games.

This article will walk you through the various operations you can perform collectively for all the apps and games you've installed. Most of these tasks are carried out through the Google Play Store, which serves as the central hub for all your device's apps and games.

## Updating All Apps and Games via Google Play Store

Navigate to Google Play Store > Manage apps & device. If any of your installed apps or games have new versions available, simply tap the "Update all" button to begin updating all apps and games on your Android device.
