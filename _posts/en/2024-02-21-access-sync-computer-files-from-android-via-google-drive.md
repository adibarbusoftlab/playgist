- ***Mirror files (recommended)***: Keep a copy of the files on the computer while also saving them in the Cloud. If you don't have internet access on your computer, you can still access the files directly from your computer with the latest synchronization.

## Security Recommendations for Shared Data

When you save documents in Google Drive, they can be accessed from your computer, smartphone, tablet, or directly online by accessing Google Drive through the browser using the link [drive.google.com/drive/](https://drive.google.com/drive/).

To ensure the safety of your data across devices and accounts, consider the following security measures:
- ***Use a Strong Password for Your Google Account***: Your Google account should use a strong password for login. Ensure it has at least 8 characters in length and includes a combination of digits, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and special characters. Make sure the password is known only to you.
- ***Secure Your Devices***: Ensure that the computers and devices from which you access shared files are protected with strong passwords or advanced biometric data, such as fingerprints.
- ***Encrypt Data on All Devices***: Implement encryption for the data stored on all your devices. Encryption adds an extra layer of security by encoding information to make it unreadable to unauthorized users.

By implementing these security measures, you can help safeguard your shared data and ensure that only authorized users have access to it across various devices and platforms.

With Google Drive, you can access and edit documents across multiple devices, including computers, smartphones, and tablets, eliminating the need for memory drives or data transferring services to manually migrate, integrate, and synchronize documents across devices.

Furthermore, your data is securely stored in the Cloud, allowing you to restore it later if it's lost from your computer.
