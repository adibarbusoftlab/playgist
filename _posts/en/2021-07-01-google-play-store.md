### Where to find the Play Store app

Mention: The application has several names, depending on the device manufacturer, the system language, and the Android version. If the system language is English, the usual names are Google Play, Play Store, and Google Play Store.

The application is preinstalled on most Android phones and tablets, apart from some devices where the manufacturer offers a similar application to Google Play (for the most part, the available content will be different from what Google offers).

For instance, the phones and tablets developed by Asian producers (Meizu, Xiaomi, etc.), provide a separate application from Google Play for users in the region. In this case, Google Play will not be installed on the device by default and, in some cases, it will not be even possible to install the application manually.

Usually, a shortcut to Google Play Store is located on the main screen.

In case Google Play does not appear on the main screen, the user has to search for it. From the Apps screen, go to the Search icon and enter Play Store. If the application exists, it will appear in the search results.

Haven't you found Google Play? Here's what you can do about it:

### What can you do when you don't find Google Play Store on your device?

If you do not find the application, the first thing you need to do is to **restart the device**, then check if it's installed and turned on.

Go to ***Settings â†’ Apps*** and search for Google Play Store in the list with apps

If there is not any application with this name, then you will have to download and install Google Play Store manually - see below.

However, if the application appears in the list, then you have to make sure that it's also enabled. Access the application, and if disabled, activate it by pressing the Enable button.

Restart the device and see if the application appear in the menu with Android apps.

### Download Play Store and install/update it manually

There are rare cases when the Play Store app is not installed by default on your phone/ tablet but fortunately, there is an option to install the app manually. The process consists in setting the device to support installing apps from external sources, downloading the Play Store app in an installable format (apk), and initiating the setting of the app on the device.

All these steps are presented in the article on ***How to download and install Play Store***

If the application appears to be installed but it cannot be found, manually installing the application will result in updating Play Store to a newer version or a particular version, which might fix the issue.

### How to use Google Play

To use the application, you need a Google Account. Once accessed, this allows you to install apps and games, and also to access and download digital content - see in the image below what the main screen of the application looks like.

Regarding the apps and games for Android, there is a high level of confidence about content security, which is tested against viruses and malicious actions. This aspect is not valid when downloading them from the Internet, from sources that are not as secure as Google.

Moreover, this app allows the management of applications, games, and digital content, on all the devices connected to a specific Google account. This aspect is useful, especially for the purchased apps and content because this becomes available on any device (phone, tablet, PC) of the user.

***The guiding principle is simple***: open Play Store, browse for the desired application, initiate the download, confirm the access rights to Android features, and wait for the install process to finish.
