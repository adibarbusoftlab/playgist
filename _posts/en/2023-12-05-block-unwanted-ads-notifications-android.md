If you're constantly bombarded with spam, scam, or rogue ads through notifications, it's essential to configure your settings and adjust permissions to gain control over and limit these notifications according to your preferences.

Abusive notifications can pose significant risks as they may spread malware or promote online scams. Therefore, it's crucial to take prompt action to block or disable them while maintaining full control over your notification settings. Clicking on such notifications might redirect you or prompt you to install apps containing malware or adware, making it increasingly challenging to manage and remove these intrusive notifications.

Learn what steps you need to take when dealing with unwanted ads and notifications.

## Identify and Disable App Pop-Up Notifications

In some instances, allowing certain apps to send notifications can result in receiving spam notifications and rogue ads on your Android device. Fortunately, you can manage these notifications either through the Android OS settings or directly from the offending app.

The app responsible for the notification typically appears at the top of the notification message. However, in some cases, the application name may be hidden. To reveal it, simply long-press the notification until the app's name is displayed.

Long-pressing a notification provides access to more details and options. From there, you should find the option to disable all notifications from that app or navigate directly to the Notification Settings, where you can manage notifications for all installed apps.

If the app responsible for the notification is unfamiliar or unused, consider uninstalling it.

If you're unable to block notifications from the identified app, follow the steps below.

## Block Pop-Up Ads and Redirects in Your Browser

Frequently, ads appear in your browser as pop-ups or redirects. Not only are these interruptions annoying, but they can also pose a risk by spreading malware, adware, and scams that target your sensitive data.

To prevent pop-ups and redirects in Chrome:
- Tap the button located at the top-right corner (three dots).
- Select "Settings."
- Go to "Site settings."
- Choose "Pop-ups and redirects."
- Toggle off the option to block all sites from displaying pop-ups and redirects, as this is the recommended setting.

To disable pop-ups and redirects in Firefox:
- Tap the button at the top-right corner (three dots).
- Select "Settings."
- Go to "Notifications."
- Choose "Blocked" to prevent pop-ups and redirects.

## Disable Pop-Ups and Notifications for an App in Android OS

After identifying the apps responsible for sending unwanted ads or notifications, you can block notification permissions directly from Android.

Here's how:
- Go to Settings > Apps.
- Select the culprit app for which you want to customize permissions.
- Tap Permissions > Notifications.
- Toggle off the option.

## Disable Ads, Recommendations, and Notifications from App Settings (if available)

When using an app or a game, you may encounter ads, recommendations, and notifications directly from the app or game itself. To minimize or disable these interruptions, you should explore the app settings to see if there's an option to turn them off.

For instance, consider YouTube, which allows you to disable notifications related to recommended videos, subscriptions, and general activity such as streams, comments, and news updates.

<img alt="Manage Youtube app notifications" title="Manage Youtube app notifications" loading="lazy" class="article-image medium-width-img" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/posts/en/block-unwanted-ads-notifications-android/manage-youtube-app-notifications.webp">

Follow the same approach for each app or game that exhibits intrusive notification behavior. Explore their settings to locate options for disabling ads, recommendations, and notifications.

## Consider Purchasing a Subscription for the App

It's important to note that you might not be able to completely block ads and notifications within an app or game while using it. Displaying ads is often a method of monetizing the effort put into producing the product, so it's something to accept as part of the experience. If you enjoy using an app or a game, you may need to manage the ads it displays.

However, in many cases, you can disable ads entirely and unlock additional features of the free version by making a purchase or subscribing to the app or game.

By opting for a subscription or making a purchase, you not only support the developers but also enhance your user experience by eliminating ads and accessing premium features.

## Personalize Ads from Google

Google offers a wide array of widely used services globally, including the Google search engine, YouTube, Gmail, and Google Drive. Additionally, Google hosts one of the most popular online advertising platforms, allowing websites and apps to monetize by displaying ads to users.

To fully utilize Android features, you need a Google account, which automatically logs you into all Google services, including ad-serving platforms. However, you have the option to disable or manage personalized ads, resulting in fewer ads and a more tailored ad experience.

Here's how to disable or manage personalized Google ads on Android:
- Visit My Ad Center at [https://myadcenter.google.com/home](https://myadcenter.google.com/home).
- In the Personalized ads section, tap the drop-down menu and select "Turn off."

- Review the necessary information and tap "Got it" to confirm the change.
By following these steps, you can customize your ad experience and reduce the visibility of awkward or irrelevant ads.

## Protect from Scams, Malware, and Adware

By implementing effective prevention measures, you can avoid being bombarded by unwanted ads and notification pop-ups.

It's crucial to maintain full control over your device's behavior. If anything becomes bothersome, you should have the option to easily block notifications and disable features or permissions through the Android OS settings.

Installing an app from an unknown or poorly reputed producer, with a low download count, and without reviewing the Terms and Conditions or requested app permissions can lead to the installation of harmful applications such as malware, adware, and scams.
