Is your phone or tablet with Android OS constantly turning off or restarting on its own? Does this happen sporadically, during specific tasks, or persistently? Initially, the issue may appear to be related to hardware, but more likely, it's a software concern.

Discover what steps you can take to diagnose and resolve your device's problem. Keep in mind that there isn't a one-size-fits-all solution for this issue, so you'll need to explore multiple approaches to increase your chances of finding the right fix.

The ultimate solution, if all else fails, is to reset your device to factory settings. However, this will only address software-related issues. If your problem stems from hardware (the worst-case scenario), you'll still need to address it separately.

## Understanding Why Your Phone Freezes, Turns Off, or Restarts

Various factors can contribute to issues such as freezing, turning off, or restarting of your phone. These culprits typically include the battery, the software state of the OS, the configuration of apps, and the hardware itself.

Depending on the behavior of the issue, it's important to consider the following:
- ***If your device restarts randomly***: The problem is likely software-related, often fixable with the steps outlined in this article.
- ***If your device shuts down or restarts during specific tasks***: Consider updating both the OS and apps. If the problem persists with a particular app, try removing or reinstalling it.
- ***If your device randomly shuts down without restarting***: This could indicate a hardware problem such as overheating, battery damage, or CPU and RAM faults. Follow the steps below to address potential software-related issues.
- ***If your device continuously restarts or turns off, rendering it unusable***: Access the Recovery Menu and attempt either wiping the cache partition (which retains app installation data without losing any settings or data) or performing a factory reset (which erases all data).

## Taking Precautions Before Taking Action

The first and most crucial step is to back up your data from your phone or tablet to an external storage device, such as a memory card, a computer, or a cloud service.

This issue could signal potential device failure, underscoring the importance of acting promptly to safeguard your data. In the worst-case scenario, a factory reset may be necessary, resulting in the loss of all your data, including photos, videos, documents, apps, and more.

## Investigating Physical Battery Problems (For Devices with Removable Batteries)

If your device features a removable battery, it's essential to investigate physical issues that may be affecting its performance.

Begin by examining the battery for any signs of deformation, swelling, or visible degradation. If you notice any of these symptoms, the culprit is likely the battery itself, necessitating a replacement.

Additionally, inspect whether the battery fits securely in its position or if there's a poor connection between the device and the battery, possibly due to dirty connectors.

Here's what you should do:
- Power off your phone.
- Remove the battery.
- Clean the connectors on both the device and the battery.
- Reinsert the battery and check for any persistent issues.

If problems persist, consider placing a small object between the battery and the phone/tablet case to ensure a secure connection with the device's connectors.

## Recalibrating Your Battery

The standard charging cycle involves starting from the lowest possible battery level and charging it to the highest level. However, many users may not adhere to this practice, especially when connecting the charger regardless of the battery level.

Charging your phone every night, regardless of the battery level, can potentially impact the battery's performance over time. This can lead to sudden drops in battery levels, difficulty in charging, or quicker-than-expected discharges.

To recalibrate the battery, follow these steps:
- Use the device until the battery is fully discharged and the device turns off.
- With the battery depleted, turn the phone on and allow it to turn off again.
- Charge the device until it reaches 100%.

Additionally, you can enhance battery protection by limiting the maximum charge to 85% of the battery capacity. To do so, navigate to ***Settings > Battery and Device Care > Battery > More Battery Settings***, and enable the option to Protect Battery.

## Ensure Your Power Button and Other Physical Buttons Are Functioning Properly

If any of the physical buttons on your device remain pressed for any reason, you may experience unexpected shutdowns or restarts.

To determine if this is the issue, follow these steps:
- ***Inspect the Buttons***: Examine the physical buttons for any signs of dirt or debris. Do they feel sticky or unresponsive when pressed? If so, it's likely that they need cleaning. Use a sharp object like a needle or toothpick to gently remove any dirt or debris.
- ***Test Each Button***: Press each button individually and observe how the operating system responds. For example, when pressing the Volume Up or Volume Down buttons, you should see a pop-up menu displaying the volume level. However, the most crucial button to check is the Power button, which we'll address next.

## Perform a Manual Restart of the Device

Your device may be undergoing background processes like updates or reverting from an update, leading to repeated or continuous shutdowns and restarts.

To address this issue, you can attempt to force a manual shutdown of the device using its physical buttons, allowing for a normal restart. Depending on your device model and manufacturer, ***initiate the shutdown sequence by pressing the Power button or the combination of Power + Volume Down for approximately 15 seconds***.

This action may help your device break through the restarting cycle and resume normal operation.

## Disable Auto-Restart Feature on Your Device

The Android OS offers an Auto Optimization feature, which can lead to automatic restarts of your phone or tablet when the device is not in use. This optimization process may involve important updates or tasks such as memory cleaning and background app closure to ensure smooth device performance.

If the Auto Restart option (Restart when needed automatically) is enabled, the device restarting issue may be temporary.

To determine if this feature is causing the problem, follow these steps:
- Navigate to ***Settings > Device Health > Auto Optimization***.
- Check to see if the option ***"Restart when needed"*** is enabled.
- If it's enabled, you can disable it to prevent unexpected restarts while you investigate the issue further. Keep in mind that disabling the auto-restart feature does not fix the underlying issue; it simply prevents automatic restarts.

Proceed to follow the steps outlined in the following sections to address the issue effectively:
- Ensure Your Android Device Is Not Overheating
- Enhance OS Performance and Battery Usage Based on Your Preferences

## Preventing Android Overheating

Frequent overheating of your phone can indeed lead to automatic shutdowns and restarts.
