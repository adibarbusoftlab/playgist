Usually, Google Play Store comes pre-installed on most Android phones and tablets. However, there are also cases when you have to manually install the latest available version, a specific version that you need, or simply reinstall the application manually due to performance problems.

In this tutorial you will learn from where to download the Play Store app and what you need to do to install it on your device, which is helpful when you are either setting up a new device or having problems with the Play Store.

## 1. Enable installation of apps (APK format) from unknown sources

By default, Android's security settings prevent the installation of apps or games from unknown or unauthorized sources. You will receive a message like the one below.

You will need to change a setting to be able to install third-party apps, which are found outside of the Play Store.

Go to ***Settings → Apps → Special access***.

Navigate to ***"Install unknown apps"*** and enable the option for the ***"My Files"*** app.

## 2. Download Google Play Store APK file

At apkmirror.com, you'll find a vast collection of Android apps that can be manually installed, including the Play Store app, known as "Google Play Store".

You can find the download page for Google Play Store [here](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/google-play-store/). Simply download the latest version compatible with your device by following the steps below.

If no compatible version is available for your device, you can opt to install Google Play services, which also includes Google Play Store.

## 3. Install Google Play Store on your phone or tablet

To install the application, navigate to the Downloads folder on your Android device and open the file containing the Google Play Store app (with the .apk extension). An installation window will appear — press the Install or Update button as applicable.
