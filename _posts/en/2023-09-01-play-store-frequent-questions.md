## What is Google Play?

Google Play is an application developed by Google that allows users to download and install different types of applications, including games, and to access multimedia content from Android devices, which is the most popular operating system for portable devices such as smartphones, tablets, etc.

Developers can share their products on Google Play, both for free and for a fee, and users are going to be able to access the desired multimedia content or to install apps, games, and so on.

Google Play combines multiple applications, like Google Play Books, Google Play Games, Google Play Movies & TV, Google Play Music, and Google Play Newsstand - all these being independent applications since before 2012 when the current release of Google Play was launched.

## Can I use Play Store without a Google Account?

No, a Google account is required to access the Google Play Store.

## Where to find Play Store and how to install apps and games?

Play Store (Google Play Store) offers access to a vast collection of apps and various digital content, and is indeed the first and the utmost used application. It is usually preinstaled and you shoud find the app on you main screen.

If you can't find it on your device, plese refer to the information provided in this article: ***How to locate Play Store and how to use it***.

## Do all Android devices come with Play Store?

Play Store exists and can only be used on Android devices that are licensed with GMS (Google Mobile Services). GMS is used by Google as a form of device standardization, through which it provides access to Google services (Play Store, Google Maps, Google Drive, Youtube, Chrome, etc.).

Devices that come from China, for example Huawei, are supplied without GMS, which is why you won't find the Google Play Store app on them. In this case, you will have to use the application store provided by device the manufacturer (in which there is a much smaller number of available apps) - you also have the option to use a Play Store alternative app, such as Gspace, or simply download the apps, stored as APK files, and install them manually.

## How do you tell if your device has GMS or not?

If there is Play Store and Google Services on the device, then it means that it's GMS licensed.

Go to ***Settings → Apps***. In the list of applications there should be Google Play Store and Google Play Services.
<img alt="Search Play Store in the list with apps" title="Search Play Store in the list with apps" class="article-image" src="/assets/images/posts/{{ page.lang }}/play-store-issues/play-store-in-apps-list.jpg">

If they do not exist, then it means that there is no GMS licensing and therefore an equivalent app for Play Store must be used.

Of course, you can try to install Play Store on you phone using the guide from here: ***Download and install Play Store on your phone***.

## Alternative to Play Store for devices without GMS

If you tried to manually install the Google Play Store app and it didn't worked, what is left for you to do is to use an alternative app store instead of Play Store.

You can use Gspace - it is customized for devices without GMS and allows downloading and installing applications / games that are also in Google Play Store.

To install it you will need to search for and install the app from your existing app store or you will need to go to the [Gspace website](https://gspaceteam.com/) and download the app from there.

## What are the disadvantages of using a device without GMS?

While devices without GMS can be more cost-effective and sometimes offer superior hardware specifications, there are limitations when it comes to app availability.

Users may need to rely on alternative apps, manually install applications, and may encounter compatibility issues. Furthermore, features like NFC-based mobile payments may not be available, and apps may not send notifications unless actively in use.

## Why can't you find Play Store on your device?

Play Store is specific to the Android operating system only, which might also come with or without GMS licence.
