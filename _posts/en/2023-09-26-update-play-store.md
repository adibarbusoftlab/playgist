## Why it's important to update and keep Play Store updated

There are many reasons why it is important for Google Play Store to stay constantly updated. The most important to mention are:
- ***Extended compatibility with a wide range of apps***: sometimes, in order to be able to download, install and run the latest applications and games, respectively to be able to update them, it may be necessary that Play Store, together with additional Google services, have the latest versions possible.
- ***Enhanced security***: Updates are released regularly to address potential vulnerabilities and security threats, and by keeping Play Store updated, you strengthen the security of your Android device, protecting your data and personal privacy.
- ***Fixing software bugs***: Updates often include fixes for bugs and performance issues that can prevent the Play Store or apps you download, install, and run from working.

## Automatic updates vs. Manual updates

Before detailing the update process, it's important to understand the difference between automatic and manual updates:
- ***Automatic updates***: By default, Play Store updates itself automatically, always having the latest version without any effort on your part.
- ***Manual updates***: Gives you control over the update process by being able to initiate updates only when you need to, for example when automatic updates aren't working properly or to make sure you're either on the latest version or on a specific version.

## Method 1: Updating through Play Store app

The easiest way to update Play Store is directly through the application. Here are the steps:

1. Open Play Store app and access the menu with account's options. (On older devices, access is via the button represented by three horizontal lines placed in the upper left corner of the screen.)
