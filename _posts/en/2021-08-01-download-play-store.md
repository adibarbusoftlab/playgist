### 1. Enable installation of apps from Unknown Sources

By default, Android's security settings prevent the installation of apps or games from unknown or unauthorized sources. You will receive a message like the one below.

You will need to change a setting to allow the installation of apps that are not found in Google Play.

Go to ***Settings → Apps → Special access***.
